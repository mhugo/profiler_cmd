This is a small library to use with the CPU profiler from Google perftools.

Indeed, there is no way for the profiler to be flushed from the exterior of the profiled program.

If you try to profile a daemon, only stopped by CTRL-C, the profile file may lack lots of data.

This library catches two signals to control the profiler :
* SIGUSR1 to start/stop it
* SIGUSR2 to flush

Start your daemon with:

CPUPROFILE=tempus.prof LD_PRELOAD=./profiler_cmd.so ./my_daemon


An in another console :

# start the profiler
killall -USR1 my_daemon
# do things to profile
# stop it
killall -USR1 my_daemon
# flush it
killall -USR2 my_daemon

Compilation:
------------
gcc -c profiler_cmd.c -lprofiler -fPIC -DPIC
ld -shared profiler_cmd.o -o profiler_cmd.so -lprofiler
